This is a PRETEND Debian server. It lives inside this page: nothing here reaches the internet, your computer,
or your real files, and everything is reset when you type exit. Break things freely.

Lessons (type the commands after the $):

 1. Look around
      $ pwd                 where am I?
      $ ls -l               what is here, with sizes and dates
      $ cd notes            go into a folder;  cd .. comes back up;  cd alone goes home
      $ cat tips.txt        read a file

 2. Read a log, the way you would on a real server
      $ tail -n 5 /var/log/syslog
      $ grep -i error /var/log/syslog
      $ grep -rn backup /var/log

 3. Find things
      $ find / -name "*.conf"
      $ find ~ -type d
      $ ls -a               "hidden" items only show with -a ... there is one in this folder

 4. Tidy up (on this machine rm really deletes; on your desktop it goes to the Recycle Bin)
      $ mkdir old
      $ mv projects/draft.txt old/
      $ cp -r notes notes-copy
      $ rm -r notes-copy
      $ echo "done lesson 4" >> progress.txt

 5. Bring a file home
      $ exit                back to your desktop
      $ scp training:notes/tips.txt ~/Documents
`;

const TIPS = `Debian tips
- Tab completes names: type "cat ti" then Tab.
- Up and down arrows bring back earlier commands; "history" lists them.
- Quotes keep spaces together: mkdir "My Folder".
- "*" matches anything: ls *.txt, rm old/*.bak
- Ctrl+C abandons the line you are typing; Ctrl+L (or clear) clears the screen.
