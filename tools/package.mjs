1. In cPanel File Manager, open your HOME folder (the one that contains public_html).
2. Upload this zip there and Extract. It adds public_html/ files and a new myiaos/ folder beside it.
   Updating later: extract the new zip the same way. Your files, accounts and myiaos/config.php are never in the zip
   (it only carries an empty myiaos/data with a lock file), so they are kept.
3. Check the host: in cPanel > Terminal run   php myiaos/tools/server-check.php
   It names anything missing (PHP version, upload size limits, the data folder).
4. Before the site answers anyone but the server itself: copy myiaos/config.example.php to myiaos/config.php and set
   'allow_remote' => true. Do this only with HTTPS working on the domain.
5. Visit the site. The first visit sets up the OWNER account. It asks for a set-up code: open cPanel File Manager,
   go to myiaos/data/accounts/ and open SETUP-CODE.txt (made the moment the page first loads). The file is
   deleted once you are set up. This stops a stranger who finds the new site first from becoming its owner.
Do not put the site behind a proxy or "Flexible SSL" CDN: the server must see the visitor's own address (for the
brakes on guessing) and a real https connection (it refuses plain http from outside).
Needs PHP 8.2+ with Argon2 password hashing. Forgotten owner password: myiaos/tools/reset-password.php (run from the
cPanel Terminal, not the web).
Held out by the sign-in brakes (wrong passwords): wait, use "Email me an unlock link" (set an unlock email in My
account first), or run  php myiaos/tools/clear-brakes.php  from the cPanel Terminal (or delete
myiaos/data/accounts/throttle.json in File Manager). Addresses listed in trusted_ips (myiaos/config.php) are never held.
Mail, the Reader's library and your own Claude or OpenRouter key need the PHP extension "openssl";
Claude and saving AI models also need "curl" (server-check.php says).
Games and other add-ons: the owner downloads them in the Application manager from the MyiaOS app store (only apps
signed by MyiaOS; they land in public_html/apps/). That needs the PHP extensions "sodium", "zip" and "openssl".
The built-in AI models are NOT in this zip: Qwen 3.5 0.8B (about 430 MB), Gemma 2 2B by Google (about
1.4 GB) and Qwen 3.5 4B (about 2.2 GB). Without them it still works: each browser fetches the model from Hugging Face when it
starts. To keep one on your own server (so browsers get it from here, and nothing is fetched from Hugging Face by
them): sign in as the owner, open Settings > AI, choose the model and press "Save to this MyiaOS"; the server fetches it
from Hugging Face in 16 MB pieces into myiaos/models/. That folder is outside public_html: only people signed in
to this desktop can fetch the files. "Remove from this MyiaOS" frees the space again; a removed model can be saved
again a day later.
Every model file is pinned to one version and checked against its SHA-256 (myiaos/lib/model-pins.json), so a file
changed upstream is never used. If Hugging Face or GitHub no longer has that version, Save fetches it from the MyiaOS
model mirror instead (https://myiaos.com/aimodels/; set 'model_mirror' in myiaos/config.php to use another, or '' for
none). Browsers never fetch from the mirror, only your server does.
(Or on your own computer run node tools/fetch-model.mjs and upload the models/ folder into myiaos/.)

What it is: copies of the three built-in AI models (about 4.3 GB), at exactly the versions MyiaOS ${version} is
pinned to. Any MyiaOS server whose owner presses "Save to this MyiaOS" after Hugging Face or GitHub has removed or
changed that version fetches it from here instead. Browsers are refused: only MyiaOS servers are served, and each
server address may take 8 GB a day (all servers together 100 GB a day). Past that: "press Save again tomorrow".

1. In cPanel File Manager, open the web root of myiaos.com (the folder its pages are in) and extract this zip there.
   It adds a folder aimodels/ (the address becomes https://myiaos.com/aimodels/).
2. In cPanel > Terminal, go to that folder and run:   php index.php fill
   It fetches the three models from Hugging Face into a folder aimodels-files beside the web root (outside it), each
   file checked against its pinned SHA-256. About 4.3 GB of disk. If it stops, run it again: it carries on.
3. Check:   php index.php status   (all three "held", and today's use).
4. Optional: aimodels/config.php returning ['files' => folder, 'per_address_gb' => 8, 'total_gb' => 100] changes the
   files folder or the daily limits.
When a new MyiaOS version pins newer models, extract its mirror zip the same way and run fill again.
